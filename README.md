## About
[CloutContracts](https://cloutcontracts.github.io/) is a smart contracts layer on top of and complimentary to BitClout, as well as potentially other social media platforms in the future as well. As a smart contracts layer, many creators onboarded to CloutContracts can create high performace DAPPs w/ an emphasis on low gas fees, customization, speed and various social aspects as well. This will eventually allow creators to build large scale networks, tokenization usecases, and bring blockchain adaptability to their fanbases. Unlike traditional rollup networks or DAPP tools, the emphasis is on the creator, adaptability, and expanded functionalities such as modular tools or microservices. CloutContracts aims to have creators feel like they aren't needing to choose between expanded functionality from running their own blockchain or accessibility from running on top of a network. This creates a new class of blockchain developers, in which ease of access is aimed towards both the most basic level to running complex lightweight apps on JavaScript or Solidity.

## Premise
CloutContracts goes well beyond traditional social media monetization strategies and implements huge core technological aspects. This is because just like other Blockchain networks or rollup layers, people can built DAPPs or smart contracts untop of CloutContracts. What sets it apart is speed, low gas fees, and adatability as well as being more creator friendly. 

## Introduction
CloutContracts as both a smart contracts layer and tool for creators, will allow for people to expand their networks to new heights.

## Main Chain
The main chain for CloutContracts will likely integrate some sort of optimistic rollup, and be focused on variation of smart contracts programmed in JavaScript and/or Solidity.

## Sidechains
CloutContracts will be easy to integrate with various sidechain compatiblity.

### Pegs
CloutContracts will also integrate pegs such as a tied BEP-20 asset and potentially other tools that wrap it, or allow it to have compatibility with other blockchains.

### DeFi
Due to the many technological integrations that CloutContracts has, flexibility w/ various DeFi apps and exchanges should be possible.

## DAPP Compatibility
A huge serious advantage that CloutContracts brings is the ability for many people to build DAPPs (decentralized applications) on top of CloutContracts.

## Faucets
Faucets are another great integration in the fact that creators can make custom faucets to distribute tokens or even run different variations of airdrops for beta-testing.

## Phase 1.0
There are multiple phases for CloutContracts including a testnet phase and mainnet. The testnet will likely revolve around integrations centered around the Agoric SDK. This is phase 1.

### Agoric SDK Integration
The Agoric SDK is for a new kind of blockchain system known as Agoric that lets you create high-level contracts centered around liquidity using JavaScript. Phase 1 as mentioned, integrates its SDK. This will be for what will be considered more of the beta or non-production phase.

## Phase 2.0
Phase 2 is the introduction of a rollup phase on top of Ethereum. This is the mainnet and expansion phase.

### Ethereum Optimistic Rollups
Optimistic rollups on Ethereum allow for low gas fees and expanded DAPP capabilities.

## Regarding Liquidity
Given many of the technological integrations and various capabilities, liquidity shouldn't be much of an issue. Infact, this exapnds upon a new class or varation of utility tokens.

## Different Utility Usecases
Most of the usecases mentioned are centered around the utilization of CloutContracts as a tool. Many people can launch their own high speed DAPPs and networks with ease, and these are part of the large usecases of CloutContracts as a whole.

### CloutPool Partnership
CloutPool can help in multiple ways. For starters, the eventual software layer that CloutPool wants to build is centered around infrastructure as code and its own various microservices. CloutContracts can be integrated into many of those systems. CloutPool can also help in the fact that many people building DAPPs on top of CloutContracts may integrate mining capability.

#### Datastore for Mining
DAPPs on CloutContracts can run various algorithms provided it is build on top of its network. This can include various PoW (Proof of Work) functions for people who want to make their smart contracts mineable.

#### Software Layer Compatibility
As mentioned, CloutContracts wants to also be integrated on various infrastructure as a code services and the software layer CloutPool is trying to built. However, CloutContracts is still its own seperate network. This means that if an application launching CloutContracts as a microservice isn't built or integrated as a plugin to CloutPool's software layer, this has no effect on CloutContracts as a network.

## The Future
In the future, there could be lots of possibilities and perhaps further phases.

## Conclusion
CloutContracts has lots of potential as not just a network, but perhaps an establisher of various protocols.

### Summary
As mentioned, CloutContracts is a smart contracts layer and network.
