## About
CloutContracts is a smart contracts layer untop of and complimentary to BitClout, as well as potentially other social media platforms in the future as well.

## Premise
CloutContracts goes well beyong traditional social media monetization strategies and implements huge core technological aspects.

## Introduction
CloutContracts as both a smart contracts layer and tool for creators, will allow for people to expand their networks to new heights.

## Main Chain
The main chain for CLoutContracts will likely integrate some sort of optimistic rollup, and be focused on variation of smart contracts programmed in JavaScript and/or Solidity.

## Sidechains
CloutContracts will be easy to integrate with various sidechain compatiblity.

### Pegs
CloutContracts will also integrate pegs such as a tied BEP-20 asset and potentially other tools that wrap it, or allow it to have compatibility with other blockchains.

### DeFi
Due to the many technological integrations that CloutContracts has, flexibility w/ various DeFi apps and exchanges should be possible.

## DAPP Compatibility
A huge serious advantage that CloutContracts brings is the ability for many people to build DAPPs (decentralized applications) untop of CloutContracts.

## Faucets
Faucets are another great integration in the fact that creators can make custom faucets to distribute tokens or even run different variations of airdrops for beta-testing.

## Phase 1.0
There are multiple phases for CloutContracts including a testnet phase and mainnet. The testnet will likely revolve around integrations centered around the Agoric SDK. This is phase 1.

### Agoric SDK Integration
The Agoric SDK is for a new kind of blockchain system known as Agoric that lets you create high-level contracts centered around liquidity using JavaScript. Phase 1 as mentioned, integrates its SDK. This will be for what will be considered more of the beta or non-production phase.

## Phase 2.0
Phase 2 is the introduction of a rollup phase untop of Ethereum. This is the mainnet and expansion phase.

### Ethereum Optimistic Rollups
Optimistic rollups on Ethereum allow for low gas fees and expanded DAPP capabilities.
